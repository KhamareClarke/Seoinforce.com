# Competitor Keyword Analysis - API Setup ✅

## Your Current Setup

You've successfully configured:
- ✅ **ScrapeOps API Key**: `14855503-d92a-4ce3-94ae-b43337990579`

## How It Works Now

### Real Competitor Analysis Flow:

1. **Add Competitor** → System scrapes their website
2. **Extract Keywords** → Real keywords from their content (title, headings, body)
3. **Get Rankings** → Uses your ScrapeOps API to get real SERP rankings
4. **Compare** → Shows real overlap and missing keyword opportunities

### What You'll See:

- ✅ **Real Keywords**: Actual keywords extracted from competitor sites
- ✅ **Real Rankings**: Actual SERP positions (using ScrapeOps API)
- ✅ **Real Overlap**: Actual keyword matches with your tracked keywords
- ✅ **Real Opportunities**: Actual missing keywords you could target

## ScrapeOps Free Tier Limits

- **100 requests/month** (free tier)
- Each competitor analysis uses ~10-50 API calls (one per keyword)
- **Tip**: Start with 1-2 competitors to test, then add more as needed

## Testing Your Setup

1. **Add a Competitor**:
   - Go to Competitor Analysis section
   - Enter a competitor domain (e.g., `competitor.com`)
   - Click "Add Competitor"

2. **Wait for Analysis**:
   - System scrapes their site (~5-10 seconds)
   - Gets rankings for extracted keywords (~10-30 seconds)
   - Displays results

3. **Check Results**:
   - You should see **real keywords** (not "mock keyword 1, 2, 3")
   - Rankings should show actual positions (1-100) or 0 if not ranking
   - Overlap and missing counts should be accurate

## Troubleshooting

### "No keywords extracted"
- Competitor site might be blocking scrapers
- Try a different competitor domain
- Check browser console for errors

### "Rankings showing as 0"
- ScrapeOps API might be rate-limited
- Check your API usage at scrapeops.io
- Wait a few minutes and try again

### "API quota exceeded"
- You've used your 100 free requests
- Wait for monthly reset or upgrade plan
- Keywords will still be extracted (just no rankings)

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Your API key is configured
2. ✅ Real keyword extraction is active
3. ✅ Real ranking lookup is active
4. 🚀 **Add competitors and see real data!**

**Note**: If you want to use SerpAPI instead, just add `SERPAPI_KEY=your_key` to `.env.local` and the system will use that instead.
